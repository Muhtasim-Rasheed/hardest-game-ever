# Hardest Game Ever

## Description

This is a game where you are a wave and there are obstacles in your way.  
They can be both moving and static. You have to avoid them and reach the end of the level.  
(Spoiler: there isn't an end yet)  
There is a leaderboard!

## Wait! Check if you have these:

1. A computer
2. A keyboard (optional)
3. A mouse
4. A screen
6. [[HARDEST REQUIREMENT]] Internet connection

## How to run

you need to change the code where the client gets the leaderboard from and submits to.
